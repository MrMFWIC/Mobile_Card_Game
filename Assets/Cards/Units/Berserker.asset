  loreText: A Viking warrior feared by all due to a single characteristic. The berserker
    fights in a blood rage, a trance-like fury, making them completely unstoppable
    in battle. With little to no reaction to pain or major injuries, a berserker
    would keep fighting with a ferocity unmatched on the battlefield through wounds
    that would have dropped a normal man.
