  loreText: The stoic defender of the Aesir and mankind alike, Thor is the god of
    thunder, who wields a hammer named Mjolnir, of which only he can lift. Thor is
    also the god of lightning, storms, strength, and protection. Often seen as the
    great protector, his legendary battles against the jotnar are viewed with awe
    and respect. The courage and physical strength of Thor is virtually unmatched
    by any being in the 9 worlds.
  bonusEffectText: Units you control cannot be destroyed by battle with a unit that
    has the same ATK.
