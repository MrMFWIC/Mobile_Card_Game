  loreText: Loki is primarily referred to as the trickster god, holding a place among
    the Aesir while not technically being a god at all, instead being from the race
    of the Jotunn. Loki is well know for his cunning and wit, and he also possesses
    the ability to change his shape and sex at will. His nature is ever-changing
    and his intentions are never clear, as he oftentimes uses his cunning to help
    the gods with his clever plans and get them out of trouble, but usually it is
    he who put them in trouble in the first place.
  bonusEffectText: Spell cards cost 1 less to activate.
